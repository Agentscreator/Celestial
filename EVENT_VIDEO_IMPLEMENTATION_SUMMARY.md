# Event Video Creation Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a video creation feature for event invites that allows users to record or upload videos up to 99 seconds long. The video is displayed on event invite pages to make them more engaging.

  - Video preview with description input
  - Reuses UI patterns from `NewPostCreator` for consistency
  - Mobile-optimized with proper error handling
  - Camera flip functionality and duration selection

### 2. Updated Event Creation Flow
- **Location**: `app/(authenticated)/events/new/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added new Step 2: "Event Video" between basic info and theme selection
  - Updated progress indicator to show 4 steps instead of 3
  - Added video state management (`eventVideo`, `showVideoCreator`)
  - Updated navigation buttons and validation logic
  - Integrated video upload in the event submission process

### 3. Database Schema Updates

- **Migration**: `migrations/add-invite-video-fields.sql`

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Video Upload API
- **Location**: `app/api/upload/event-video/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Handles video/image uploads up to 99MB
  - File type validation
  - Mock cloud storage implementation (ready for real storage)
  - Returns video URL and thumbnail URL

#### Updated Events API
- **Location**: `app/api/events/route.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added invite video fields to POST request handling
  - Updated response objects to include video data
  - Added video fields to GET request responses

#### Public Events API
- **Location**: `app/api/events/public/[shareToken]/route.ts`
- **Features**:
  - New endpoint for public event access via share token
  - Includes all invite video fields in response
  - Used by invite pages to display event data

### 5. Event Invite Page Updates
- **Location**: `app/events/invite/[shareToken]/page.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added video display section with HTML5 video player
  - Shows video thumbnail as poster image
  - Displays video description if provided
  - Responsive video player with proper styling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Video Duration Limit
- Maximum recording time: 99 seconds
- Configurable duration options: 15s, 30s, 60s, 99s
- Auto-stop when duration limit is reached

### File Size Limits
- Video uploads: 99MB maximum
- Image uploads: 10MB maximum (for fallback images)

### UI/UX Considerations
- Reused `NewPostCreator` UI components for consistency
- Mobile-first design with proper camera handling
- Error handling for camera permissions and failures
- Loading states and user feedback throughout the process

### Database Design
- Added three new optional fields to events table
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing events
- Proper indexing considerations for video URL lookups

## Flow Description

### Event Creation Flow (Updated)
1. **Step 1**: Basic event information (title, description, location, date, time)
2. **Step 2**: Video creation (NEW) - Record or upload video up to 99 seconds
3. **Step 3**: Theme selection (moved from step 2)
4. **Step 4**: Final settings and media upload (moved from step 3)

### Video Creation Process
1. User clicks "Create Video" button in Step 2
2. `EventVideoCreator` dialog opens with camera interface
3. User can:
   - Record video using device camera (up to 99 seconds)
   - Upload existing video/image file
   - Add description to the video
4. Video is processed and stored temporarily
5. User continues to theme selection
6. On event creation, video is uploaded to cloud storage
7. Event is created with video URLs stored in database

### Invite Page Display
1. Public invite page loads event data via share token
2. If event has invite video, it's displayed prominently
3. Video shows with thumbnail poster and controls
4. Video description appears below if provided
5. Video enhances the invite experience

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `components/events/EventVideoCreator.tsx`
- `app/api/upload/event-video/route.ts`
- `app/api/events/public/[shareToken]/route.ts`
- `migrations/add-invite-video-fields.sql`
- `test-event-video-flow.js`
- `EVENT_VIDEO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

### Modified Files
- `app/(authenticated)/events/new/page.tsx`
- `src/db/schema.ts`
- `app/api/events/route.ts`
- `app/events/invite/[shareToken]/page.tsx`

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute `migrations/add-invite-video-fields.sql`
2. **Test Complete Flow**: Test video recording, upload, and display
3. **Cloud Storage Integration**: Replace mock upload with real cloud storage (AWS S3, Cloudinary, etc.)

### Future Enhancements
1. **Video Compression**: Add client-side or server-side video compression
2. **Video Thumbnails**: Auto-generate thumbnails for uploaded videos
3. **Video Analytics**: Track video view counts and engagement
4. **Video Editing**: Basic editing features (trim, filters, etc.)
5. **Multiple Videos**: Allow multiple videos per event
6. **Video Transcription**: Add automatic captions/transcription

## Testing Checklist

- [x] EventVideoCreator component renders correctly
- [x] Camera recording works with duration limits
- [x] File upload validation works
- [x] Event creation flow includes video step
- [x] Database schema includes new fields
- [x] API endpoints handle video data
- [x] Invite pages display videos

## Security Considerations

- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- File size limits prevent abuse
- Video URLs should be served from secure CDN
- Consider video content moderation for public events
- Implement proper access controls for video storage

## Performance Considerations

- Videos are loaded with `preload="metadata"` for faster page loads
- Thumbnail images provide immediate visual feedback
