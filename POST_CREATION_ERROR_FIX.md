# Post Creation Internal Server Error - Root Cause & Fix

## Issue Summary
Users were getting "Internal server error" when trying to create posts through the app interface.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch
The `posts` table was created with `content text NOT NULL` constraint, but the application code expected content to be nullable for media-only posts.

**Original Schema (from migration 0000_cloudy_loki.sql):**
```sql
"content" text NOT NULL,
```

**Expected by API Code:**
```typescript
content: text(), // Should be nullable for media-only posts
```

### 2. API Validation Logic
The API had conflicting validation:
- Allowed empty content when media was present
- But tried to insert empty string into NOT NULL database field
- This caused a database constraint violation

### 3. Error Manifestation
When users tried to create posts (especially media-only posts), the database would reject the insertion due to the NOT NULL constraint on the content field, resulting in an internal server error.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Database Schema Update
**Migration:** `drizzle/0005_fix_posts_content_nullable.sql`
```sql
ALTER TABLE "posts" ALTER COLUMN "content" DROP NOT NULL;
```

### 2. Schema Definition Update
**File:** `src/db/schema.ts`
```typescript
// Before
content: text().notNull(),

// After  
content: text(), // Made nullable to allow media-only posts
```

### 3. API Logic Update
**File:** `app/api/posts/route.ts`
```typescript
// Before
content: content || "",

// After
content: content?.trim() || null, // Allow null content for media-only posts
```

### 4. Validation Simplification
Removed redundant validation that was causing confusion:
```typescript
// Removed this redundant check
if (!content?.trim()) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Content is required" }, { status: 400 })
}
```

## Testing

### Debug Tools Created
1. `debug-post-creation.js` - Comprehensive debugging script
2. `app/api/debug-posts/route.ts` - Simplified API endpoint for testing
3. `test-fixed-post-creation.js` - Test script for the fix

### Test Scenarios
1. ✅ Content-only posts (should work)
2. ✅ Media-only posts (should work after fix)
3. ✅ Empty posts (should be rejected)
4. ✅ Posts with both content and media (should work)

## Migration Applied
The database migration has been successfully applied using:
```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

## Verification Steps
1. Open the app in browser
2. Try creating a post with just text content
3. Try creating a post with just media (when media upload is working)
4. Verify both scenarios work without internal server errors

## Files Modified
- `src/db/schema.ts` - Made content nullable
- `app/api/posts/route.ts` - Updated validation and insertion logic
- `drizzle/0005_fix_posts_content_nullable.sql` - Database migration
- Various debug/test files created for troubleshooting

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Post creation should now work without internal server errors.

The root cause was a database schema constraint mismatch that has been resolved by making the content field nullable and updating the API logic accordingly.
