# Camera Zoom Fix Summary

## Issue
The video in NewPostCreator.tsx was appearing zoomed in when recording, causing the camera view to be cropped and not showing the full field of view.

## Root Causes
1. **CSS Object Fit**: The video elements were using `object-cover` which crops the video to fill the container
2. **Camera Constraints**: The video constraints were too restrictive with specific width/height values that didn't match device capabilities
3. **Aspect Ratio Mismatch**: The constraints were forcing a portrait aspect ratio that caused cropping

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Video Element Styling
**File**: `components/new-post/NewPostCreator.tsx`

**Before**:
```tsx
className="w-full h-full object-cover"
```

**After**:
```tsx
className="w-full h-full object-contain bg-black"
```

**Impact**: 
- `object-contain` shows the full video without cropping
- `bg-black` provides a clean background for letterboxing if needed
- Applied to both camera preview and recorded video preview

### 2. Improved Camera Constraints
**File**: `utils/camera.ts`

**Before**:
```typescript
video: {
  width: { ideal: 720, min: 480 },
  height: { ideal: 1280, min: 640 },
  facingMode: options.facingMode
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
video: {
  facingMode: options.facingMode,
  width: { ideal: 1280, max: 1920 },
  height: { ideal: 720, max: 1080 },
  aspectRatio: { ideal: 16/9 }, // Standard aspect ratio to prevent cropping
  frameRate: { ideal: 30 }
}
```

**Impact**:
- More flexible resolution constraints
- Standard 16:9 aspect ratio prevents cropping
- Better compatibility across devices

### 3. Added Fallback Constraint System
**File**: `utils/camera.ts`

Added multiple fallback levels:
1. **Primary**: Detailed constraints with resolution and aspect ratio
2. **Secondary**: Simple constraints with just facingMode and audio
3. **Tertiary**: Video-only with detailed constraints
4. **Final**: Video-only with just facingMode

**Impact**:
- Ensures camera works even if device doesn't support specific constraints
- Graceful degradation for older devices
- Better error handling and user experience

## Testing
Created `test-camera-zoom-fix.html` to verify:
- Camera starts without zoom issues
- Video displays full field of view
- Front/back camera switching works
- Resolution information is displayed
- Fallback constraints work properly

## Expected Results
- Video preview shows full camera field of view without cropping
- No more "zoomed in" appearance
- Better compatibility across different devices
- Maintains video quality while fixing zoom issue
- Smooth camera switching between front and back cameras

## Usage
The changes are automatically applied when using the NewPostCreator component. Users should now see:
- Full camera view without excessive cropping
- Proper aspect ratio maintenance
- Better video recording experience
- Consistent behavior across devices
