# Post Saving Issues - Diagnosis and Fixes

## Common Issues Identified

### 1. **Database Schema Issues**
- The `content` field was NOT NULL but needs to be nullable for media-only posts
- Missing required fields like `hasPrivateLocation` with proper defaults

### 2. **Form Data Processing**
- Complex media upload logic can fail and prevent post creation
- Large file uploads timing out
- Blob storage failures blocking entire post creation

### 3. **Session/Authentication**
- Session validation failing in some cases
- User ID not properly extracted

### 4. **Error Handling**
- Errors in one part of the process (like group creation) failing the entire post
- Insufficient error logging

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Database Schema Fix**
```sql
-- Already applied in fix-posts-content-nullable.sql
ALTER TABLE "posts" ALTER COLUMN "content" DROP NOT NULL;
```

### 2. **Simplified Post Creation Flow**
Created `/api/posts-simple` endpoint that:
- Uses JSON instead of FormData for testing
- Minimal required fields only
- Better error handling and logging
- Separate media upload from post creation

### 3. **Main API Improvements Needed**
The main `/api/posts` route needs these fixes:

1. **Separate media upload from post creation**
2. **Better error isolation** - don't fail entire post if group creation fails
3. **Improved validation** - check required fields before processing
4. **Transaction handling** - ensure post is saved even if secondary operations fail

### 4. **Frontend Improvements**
The `NewPostCreator` component should:
1. **Retry logic** for failed uploads
2. **Better error messages** for users
3. **Fallback to text-only** if media upload fails
4. **Progress indicators** for long uploads

## Testing Steps

1. Run the diagnostic script: `debug-post-saving-issue.js`
2. Test simple post creation: `/api/posts-simple`
3. Test main API with minimal data
4. Test with media files
5. Check database directly for saved posts

## Immediate Actions

1. **Use the diagnostic script** to identify the exact failure point
2. **Test with simple endpoint** to verify database connectivity
3. **Check browser console** for detailed error logs
4. **Verify environment variables** are properly set
5. **Check database constraints** and recent migrations
