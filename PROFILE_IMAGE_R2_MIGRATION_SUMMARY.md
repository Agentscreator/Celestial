# Profile Image Upload - Cloudflare R2 Migration Summary

## Issue
Profile image upload was failing with "Error uploading profile image: Error: Failed to upload image" because it was still using Vercel Blob storage instead of Cloudflare R2.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Profile Image Upload API (`app/api/users/profile-image/route.ts`)
- ❌ **Removed**: `import { put } from '@vercel/blob'`
- ✅ **Added**: `import { uploadToR2 } from "@/src/lib/r2-storage"`
- ❌ **Removed**: Custom `uploadToStorage` function using Vercel Blob
- ✅ **Updated**: Upload logic to use `uploadToR2` with folder `"profile-images"`

### 2. Updated Stories API (`app/api/stories/route.ts`)
- ❌ **Removed**: `import { put } from '@vercel/blob'`
- ✅ **Added**: `import { uploadToR2 } from "@/src/lib/r2-storage"`
- ✅ **Updated**: Media upload logic to use R2 with proper folder structure (`stories/videos` or `stories/images`)

### 3. Updated Messages Upload API (`app/api/messages/upload/route.ts`)
- ❌ **Removed**: `import { put } from '@vercel/blob'`
- ✅ **Added**: `import { uploadToR2 } from "@/src/lib/r2-storage"`
- ✅ **Updated**: File upload logic to use R2 with folder `"messages"`

### 4. Updated Test Media Upload API (`app/api/test-media-upload/route.ts`)
- ❌ **Removed**: `import { put } from "@vercel/blob"`
- ✅ **Added**: `import { uploadToR2 } from "@/src/lib/r2-storage"`
- ✅ **Updated**: Upload logic to use R2 with folder `"test-uploads"`

### 5. Cleaned Up Posts API (`app/api/posts/[id]/route.ts`)
- ❌ **Removed**: Unused `import { put } from "@vercel/blob"`

## Verification

### Environment Variables (Already Configured ✅)
```env
R2_ENDPOINT=https://2b8e11c545d78dd5ce3c39b5e38a1d84.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=1d5d4264e128d41aa9302bdd5e36c6d5
R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=8243b37fd0f314f2a50e2e9c7f334929708286ac358c253bb963755831b02bf0
R2_BUCKET_NAME=mirro
R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://pub-f50a78c96ae94eb08dea6fb65f69d0e1.r2.dev
```

### Test Script Created
- `test-profile-image-upload.js` - Test script to verify profile image upload functionality

## Expected Results

After these changes:
1. ✅ Profile image uploads should work properly
2. ✅ All uploaded images will be stored in Cloudflare R2
3. ✅ Image URLs will use the R2 public domain (`pub-f50a78c96ae94eb08dea6fb65f69d0e1.r2.dev`)
4. ✅ Upload errors should be resolved

## Folder Structure in R2
- `profile-images/` - User profile pictures
- `stories/images/` - Story images
- `stories/videos/` - Story videos  
- `messages/` - Message attachments
- `test-uploads/` - Test files

## Next Steps
1. Test profile image upload functionality
2. Verify that uploaded images are accessible via R2 URLs
3. Monitor for any remaining upload errors
4. Consider removing Vercel Blob dependency from package.json if no longer needed
